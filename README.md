# Kayak Gear Reviews
Sorting through what works and does not with kayak gear can be a confusing, costly, and monumental task. There are a lot of opinions, often based on personal taste and paddling style on the web (some reviews very old or dated) and with your fellow club members, paddlers, and others you connect with while paddling. Many recent reviews for a lot of outdoor gear feature an overview, pluses/minuses, cost and honest reviewing, except they lack evaluations of how products work over longer periods. Often the reviewer has just used the product a few times.
