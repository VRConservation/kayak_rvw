## Takeaways
1. **Portfolio strategy**. Be strategic about what funds you utilize for different projects and programs. It may be best to look to foundations and business support grants for organizational startup or administrative costs. Still, implementation grants for field projects and private or bank loans for scaling once a feedstock aggregation entity is established.
2. **Temporal ramping**. Revenue sources outside the realm of taxes and grants may be difficult to create and execute with risk-averse agencies and organizations. Try funding with traditional resources, such as grants, first, and then gradually introduce new resources to diversify your funding portfolio and help establish a new organization's financial stability over time.
3. **Grant dependence & giving**. In a similar vein, just because grants are available doesn't mean that will be the case indefinitely. As soon as you secure a grant or two, think about how to leverage it with other funding sources and work tirelessly to create more dependable and steady income sources than grants. It may seem daunting, but remember that the single largest source of charitable giving in the United States comes from individuals, not foundations, corporations, or grant-making agencies. The single largest source is also the least restricted type of funding, so it is critical for covering operational expenses (which are often underfunded by grants). Develop a strategy to cultivate local support through individual donations.

## Recommendations
1. **Utilize public funds for startup and traditional projects**. Public funding is readily available and generally suitable for trials or the initial development of feasible but new ideas.
2. **Pilot non-traditional, higher risk, or new revenue sources as pilots**. Then, ramp them up with success, and participating entities and partners see their value and understand how they work.
3. **Co-house staff and resources**. Utilize existing offices and share staff and other resources as capacity and funding allows. This is particularly important during the startup and early phases of developing a JPA.
4. **Incorporate feedstock insurance**. To de-risk feedstock pricing and also attract new investors to wood product businesses.
5. **Leverage public funds with private investment**. When public funds are secured, immediately work to leverage them with other public and private funding resources. Don't wait until near the end of grants to look for additional funds.
6. **Sort yards with wood campuses or easements**. Could land trusts or agencies that fund easements include sort yards as part of restoration efforts?
7. **Use the right revenue source**. Property and sales tax increases are more effective in populated areas with higher incomes; however, they usually are not appropriate for disadvantaged rural where the tax base and population tend to be to low to provide enough funding.
