# Summary
Every kayaker needs wetsuit boots, especially paddling in colder conditions, which is pretty much all the time! The Lomo wetsuit boots are tough, warm, and very reasonably priced compared to other similar boots. My only gripe about them is the zippers can freeze, even if rinsing after every use (make sure to always store them with zippers zipped) and the sizing may run a bit large. This is a bonus, however for fitting over drysuit booties and when wearing extra layers in winters.
