# Summary
This helmet just looks cool, plus you get a visor to keep the sun out. I'm not sure whether to start singing Kiss's Strutter or Sweet's Ballroom Blitz when I put this helmet on but it does make you want to go out and surf some waves, run a tiderace, or negotiate splosh. Altho, generally pricey can often get them on sale. At the time of publishing Escape Watersports had a neon green Strutter for sale at 춲49.99. As mentioned, in the cons, I found the headband to be uncomfortable at first after about 1 hr of paddling. This has gradually subsided and I'm not sure whether I broke in the helmet or it broke me.
