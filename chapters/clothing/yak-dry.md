# Summary
I was super jealous of kayakers with hoods when I first bought this suit and realized it was made more for river kayakers. But I soon realized that having a hood in wind blows and you never use the hoods anyway so it's awesome. The suit is duper durable with cordura in hard wearing areas. I found the latex neck seal to be very tight and had to cut several notches down to fit me (and I have a pretty skinny neck). It was so tight it felt like someone was choking me and I dreaded putting it on. Once I trimmed it, it was fine. Besides the neck the suit fits well. I found the shoulder zipper to be difficult to reach and close, but that became much easier with a few applications of ti-zip to lube it. The flap over the zipper also gets stuck up or the wind blows it up. Seems like this could be removed, or fixed down with some double sided velcro. 

This suit doesn't breath as well as more expensive suits, but if you layer right, you can avoid excessive moisture build up on the inside. It dries very fast, even the booties. I've had mine for 3 years and the only sign of wear is in the 'socks' and I had to sew and patch the neoprene in the neck after it tore. Really good value for money, especially for your first suit when you're trying things out and don't want to spend a ton on new kit.
