# Summary
Different colors, deck out your boat with rad colored hatches.

# Buyer
Anyone that wants to or needs to replace the hatches that came with their boat. These are a much improved version, for instance of the NDK hatch covers. I have three that I've fitted on NDK and P&H boats. Steve Whetman first mentioned they're designed for fiberglass boats, but I've found they work on plastic boats as well. They work! What more can you say. 

# Specs
Cost: variable by size.
