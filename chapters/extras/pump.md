# Summary
I really liked this pump until I was pumping out my cockpit following an exercise rescue in F5 winds and 2m swell. It still pumped and I've since taped it up, but makes me wonder what else might break when I really need it. Other than that questionable durability, this pump works well, with high volume water compared to smaller bilge pumps. The floaty foam circle on it is deteriorating but saltwater and sun exposure has a tendency to degrade material like this over time. None of the metal has rusted, a big plus, and something on other 'seaworthy' gear that you would think would be required.

# Buyer
Everyone needs a pump for rescues, general leakage and every single time you land for lunch and your cockpit has taken on more than a few spongeful (spongefulls?) of water.
