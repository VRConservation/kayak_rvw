# Summary
Full disclosure: I purchased this boat used so it's features and design may have been updated in newer models. The age of this boat, however is testimony to its durability.

Hatches
Skeg
Cockpit bolts ripping clothing and trap hazard
Hard line on cockpit sraping shins. again had to tap over this. filing might even be a better solution
Not really sure why the cockpit rim is fibreglass rather than moulded, which would be smoother. That supposedly reduces weight and makes it stiff, but it means that you scrape body parts on it. In my boat the rim is attached with bolt that are raw on the inside and have ripped clothing when exiting the boat and even momentarily trapped me during rescue exercises. I've taped over these to avoid that in the future, but it's something to be aware of and certainly something the manufacturer should fix, e.g., cut off ends or put caps on them.

Could really use some actual knee braces, hip pads, and an adjustable back brace.

NDK says 'The kayak has been designed to fit a range of kayakers from approx. 5ft 4inch (162 cm) to 6ft 4inches (193 cm) tall & there is plenty of room for large feet.' There's no way someone 193 cms could easily get their legs in and out of this boat. I'm 6'1" and always scrape my knees getting out.

# Buyer
Beginner to intermediate (short, e.g., <175 cm) paddler who likes rockhopping, waves, and smooth to rough water conditions.
