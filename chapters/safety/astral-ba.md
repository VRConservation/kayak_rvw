# Summary
Great fitting jacket for long distance paddles ({numref}`astral`)

Bladder pocket is for Astral bladders that don't seem to exist. It isn't a pocket anyway, since it's on the inside of the vest and would be uncomfortable if a bladder was fitted in the tiny place.

The pockets at the waist are inaccessible during paddling. The hand warmer pocket is useful, but the neoprene-ish material at the bottom gets wet and stays wet somewhat negating the warming function and making the jacket difficult to dry after use.

The clamshell pockets at the front is awesome and easily accessible as well as being useful for a 'tray' while sorting through kit. It is too small, however and I'm unable to fit much in the pocket other than knife, camera, ouch pouch, whistle, and compass. Even then it's bulging

A smaller strap on the shoulder strap for attaching a radio or emergency GPS beacon broke after about 18 months of use. Fortunately it has a sturdier plastic backing.
