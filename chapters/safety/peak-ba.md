# Summary
Front entry system with zip makes this buoyancy aid easy to don and doff ({numref}`peak`). My only minor complaints are the jacket are the many straps to fit to your body can be fiddly and they loosen. The jacket also is not as comfortable, say, as the Astral, especially on longer journeys. However, it's 춲100 less and made of eco-friendly recycled materials (and made in the UK--I think--rather than the US).
