# Kayak Reviews
The Kayak Gear Review Book features short- and long-term kayak gear reviews for beginners and seasoned veterans alike. All reviews are of kit that either I have or guest authors have purchased and used, preferably over several years of use.

Each chapter is organized with a pros cons table, for example:


| **PROS**                            | **CONS**                       |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 游릭 Excellent comfort | 游리 Fit may not work for some |
| 游릭 Waterproof & breathable construction | 游리 Expensive price point |
| 游릭 Great in varied temperatures and conditions | 游리 Hood blows off in windy conditions |


The table is followed by a summary overview of the gear's performance, who the gear is for, and brief specs including cost at time of review, weight from my scales, and a url to the manufacturer or place to purchase the item.

# Chapters
The book is organized into broad categorical chapters featuring equipment we have tried in each category. It isn't an exhaustive list, rather it's meant to feature commonly used or needed items and items that we have actually worn on numerous trips from flatwater to tideraces and other advanced conditions. The chapters are organized in the following manner:

1. **Clothing**. Performance clothing kayakers wear on the water.
2. **Extras**. Other necessary pieces of kit, e.g., pump.
3. **Kayaks**. Reviews of the kayaks most often purchased by beginner to advanced paddlers.
4. **Paddles**. Paddle reviews. There are millions of paddles out there, how do you choose the right one? These will help (and hopefully help you avoid spend loads 춲춲춲s on a paddle you don't like).
5. **Safety gear**. Essential safety gear and reviews of gear that worked, bt not as well as current kit.

# Contribution
Review contributions are welcome! Please feel free to reach out and offer kit reviews. The easiest way to do this is to visit the github [repo](https://github.com/VRConservation/kayak_rvw), download one of the chapter markdown files, write the review then make a pull request.
